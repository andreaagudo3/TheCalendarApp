### High Level Layers

#### MVP Concepts

##### Presentation Logic
* `View` - delegates user interaction events to the `Presenter` and displays data passed by the `Presenter`
    * All `UIViewController`, `UIView`, `UITableViewCell` subclasses belong to the `View` layer
    * It shouldn't contain any complex logic.
* `Presenter` - contains the presentation logic and tells the `View` what to present
    * Usually we have one `Presenter` per scene (view controller)
    * It doesn't reference the concrete type of the `View`, but rather it references the `View` protocol that is implemented usually by a `UIViewController` subclass
    * It should be a plain `Swift` class and not reference any `iOS` framework classes - this makes it easier to reuse it maybe in a `macOS` application
    * It should be covered by Unit Tests
* `Configurator` - injects the dependency object graph into the scene (view controller)
* `Coordinator` - contains navigation / flow logic from one scene to another
    * Tt might be referred to as a `FlowCoordinator`
    * It should be referenced only by the `Presenter`.

### TheCalendarApp Details

* The demo applications tries to expose a fairly complex set of features that justifies the usage of the concepts presented above
* __Unit Tests__ are missing at the moment.
* __Code comments__ can be found in several classes highlighting different design decisions or referencing followup resources
* The project structure tries to follow clean code concept that can be found in the references section
